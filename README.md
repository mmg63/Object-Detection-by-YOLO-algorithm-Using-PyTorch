# Object Detection by YOLO algorithm Using PyTorch
 Object Detection by YOLO algorithm Using PyTorch

The YOLO detection code is here is base on Erik Lindernoren’s implementation of Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhad ’s paper. 

There are several algorithms for object detection, with YOLO and SSD among the most popular.
I will use YOLOv3.
